        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I’ve spent over a decade helping others in the community access support — but I’ve also lived the barriers firsthand. As a mother, an advocate, and someone diagnosed with ADHD in my 40s after decades of masking, I know how isolating and complex these systems can be.</p>
        <p>While seeking autism and ADHD assessments for my children during lockdowns, I heard “no, we can’t help you” more times than I can count. That experience — layered across public and private sectors — is what taught me to weave between services, fill the gaps, and stand beside those left out.</p>
