        <p>I didn’t have a title. I didn’t have permission. I just saw someone who needed help and brought them home with me.</p>
        <p>It was primary school. A friend of mine was in a situation that didn’t feel right — and I didn’t have the words, but I knew they needed safety. So I walked them home to my house. I don’t remember asking anyone. I just acted. It was instinct.</p>
        <p>Back then, I thought adults would take over and make it okay.</p>
        <p>Reflecting now, I understand a lot more.</p>
        <p>I remember how frustrated I felt when my parents couldn’t help. I remember the heaviness when my friend had to go back to a place they didn’t feel safe in. And I remember the silence that followed — the kind of silence that happens when systems fail. My friend disappeared from school after that. To this day, I don’t know what happened to her.</p>
        <p>That was my first experience of doing the right thing — and watching the system do nothing.</p>
        <p>It shaped how I see advocacy. Sometimes it starts with a gut feeling. Sometimes it ends without closure. But I’ve never stopped stepping forward when someone needs to be seen.</p>
