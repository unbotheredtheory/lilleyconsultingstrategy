    <h1>About Lilley Consulting & Strategy</h1>
    <p>I'm Tracy Lilley — an independent social worker, strategist, and advocate. I started this consultancy with one goal: to support people navigating complex, fragmented systems that too often say, “We can’t help you.”</p>

    <p>With both professional and lived experience across health, disability, education, and legal systems, I bring clarity, structure, and strategy to people’s most personal challenges. My work focuses on restoring your story with integrity and supporting you to be heard — without having to repeat yourself at every turn.</p>

    <blockquote>"I built this business out of a refusal to be told 'we can’t help you.'"</blockquote>

    <p>Whether you’re documenting a timeline, preparing for an agency meeting, or stuck between systems that don’t speak to each other, I work alongside you to uncover the patterns, ask the right questions, and create tools that bring your history into focus — in your own words.</p>

    <p>Advocacy isn’t something I studied first. It’s something I lived. And now it’s what I do — with purpose, persistence, and proof.</p>
