        <p>Hi, I’m Tracy Lilley. I’ve been advocating for others for over a decade — but I’ve also spent much longer learning how to navigate systems for myself and my family.</p>
        <p>Diagnosed with ADHD in 2021 after masking for over 40 years, I understand what it means to fall through the cracks. While seeking support for my children during the COVID lockdowns — both undergoing assessments for autism and ADHD — I encountered the same roadblocks I’d seen countless others face: confusion, gatekeeping, and “we can’t help you.”</p>
        <p>I built this business as a way to turn hard-earned insight into support for others navigating similar challenges. I combine formal training with real-world experience to help people feel seen, heard, and supported.</p>
