    <blockquote>
      <p>I really don’t think I would be here if it were not for Tracy.</p>
      <p>We knew each other at school and lost contact until sometime in the 2010s. This was when we started chatting via social media platforms, and I realised she had grown personally a lot. I was taken aback...</p>
      <p>In 2021, I underwent several surgeries... Tracy reached out when I was at my lowest — drinking, prescription drugs, limited mobility, and a mental health spiral. She just knew.</p>
      <p>It was Tracy who found a place for me to reside and get help. It was Tracy who told the health professionals what for, and Tracy who has kept me pushing for answers — because she heard.</p>
      <p>Since then, she’s had my back completely. She listens, distracts with kindness (“Send me photos of your garden”), and gently helps me reset...</p>
      <p>If Tracy hadn’t reached out, I believe I would have been dismissed until I took my own life. I wasn’t far from it.</p>
      <p>I can’t thank her enough. I am privileged to call her a true friend, a lovely human, and an absolutely courageous wahine.</p>
